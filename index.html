    <!--- Removing div in lines 29-30 because it is a non semantic element-- replacing with <article> because it a semantic element that defines the content on the page-  -->

            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business.
            </p>
            <!-- Adding a </article> instead of div to close out the properties in lines 29-35 -->
        </article>
        <!-- changing div to <section> to make it more semantic lines 39-45 -->
        <section class="online-reputation-management">
            <!-- In line 42 I included the alt= attribute to make the image accessible -->

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.
            </p>
        </section>
        <!-- Again replacing div to article to make it more semantic  -->
        <article class="social-media-marketing">

            <img src="./assets/images/social-media-marketing.jpg" alt="image of social media marketing" class="float-left"/>
            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and increase your lead generation.
            </p>
        </article>
    </section>
    <!-- replacing div with aside because it is more semantic and on the original image webpage this section is to the side -->
    <aside class="benefits">
        <!-- replaced div with figure because the mini images within the text seemed more appropriate same thing for code lines 64-65, 71, 72,78 -->
        <figure class="benefit-lead">
            <h3>Lead Generation</h3>
            <!-- In line 63 I included the alt= attribute to make the image accessible -->
            <img src="./assets/images/lead-generation.png"  alt="image of lead-generation"/> 
            <p>
                Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, bringing customers directly to your website.

            <h3>Brand Awareness</h3>

            <p>
                As the search ranking for your business increases, your advertising costs decrease, and you no longer need to advertise your page.
